# CS163 - Data Structures

This is a repo of basic development/application of the following data strucutures: Stacks, Queues, Trees (BST), and Hash Tables. Also includes basic program involving Linear Linked Lists.

All work is my own, with limited client application development. The focus for each program is on the backend ADT design.
